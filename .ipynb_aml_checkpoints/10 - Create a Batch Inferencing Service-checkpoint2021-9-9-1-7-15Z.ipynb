        "Imagine a health clinic takes patient measurements all day, saving the details for each patient in a separate file. Then overnight, the diabetes prediction model can be used to process all of the day's patient data as a batch, generating predictions that will be waiting the following morning so that the clinic can follow up with patients who are predicted to be at risk of diabetes. With Azure Machine Learning, you can accomplish this by creating a *batch inferencing pipeline*; and that's what you'll implement in this exercise."
